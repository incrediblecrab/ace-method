# The ACE Method

**Stop wasting time with trial-and-error AI prompting.** The ACE Method is a proven five-phase framework that transforms how you work with AI assistants - from confused back-and-forth to systematic project completion.

## The Problem We Solve

Most people use AI assistants reactively - asking random questions, getting partial answers, and struggling to build anything substantial. The ACE Method changes this by providing structure that:

- Captures all requirements upfront (preventing costly rework)
- Maintains context across conversations (no more repeating yourself)
- Delivers production-ready solutions (not just toy examples)
- Teaches you patterns for future projects (compound learning effect)


## The Five Phases

The ACE Method consists of five sequential phases, each building upon the previous:

**Phase 1: START** - Define your vision and establish project foundations
**Phase 2: ANALYZE** - Uncover hidden requirements and design architecture  
**Phase 3: CREATE** - Build iteratively with continuous problem-solving
**Phase 4: EVALUATE** - Stress test before release
**Phase 5: COMMIT** - Deploy professionally and establish operations

### Phase 1: START - Define Your Vision

Every successful project begins with clarity. The START phase transforms vague ideas into actionable specifications by systematically capturing project identity, scope, and constraints.

#### Key Elements

- **Project Identity**: Name, type, and core purpose
- **Impact & Users**: Who benefits and what problem is solved
- **Your Context**: Background, resources, and quality expectations
- **Scope Definition**: Essential outcomes, nice-to-haves, and non-goals
- **Constraints**: Hard limits and flexible preferences

#### What You'll Receive

1. **Quantified Scope Assessment** - Realistic evaluation of project feasibility
2. **Architecture Decision Record** - Technology recommendations with rationale
3. **Risk Register with Mitigations** - Identified risks and mitigation strategies
4. **Structured Learning Plan** - What to learn and when
5. **Project Constitution** - Core principles for decision-making

### Phase 2: ANALYZE - Uncover Hidden Requirements

The ANALYZE phase prevents the #1 cause of project failure: discovering critical requirements too late. This phase uses systematic thinking to uncover what you don't know you need.

#### Key Elements

- **Problem Deep Dive**: Root causes and current workarounds
- **User Journeys**: How different users will interact with the solution
- **System Boundaries**: Core capabilities and integration points
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable definitions of success
- **Assumptions & Risks**: What you're taking for granted

#### What You'll Receive

1. **Requirements X-Ray Report** - Hidden requirements you missed
2. **Living Architecture Document** - System design with clear boundaries
3. **Reality-Based Prioritization** - Features ranked by criticality
4. **Pre-Mortem Risk Analysis** - Potential failure modes and prevention
5. **Go/No-Go Checklist** - Clear criteria for proceeding

### Phase 3: CREATE - Get Unstuck, Stay Moving

The CREATE phase provides iterative problem-solving support as you build. Each interaction helps you get unstuck while learning patterns to prevent similar issues.

#### Key Elements

- **Current Context**: What you're working on and project state
- **The Situation**: Expected vs actual behavior
- **Code Context**: Your implementation attempts
- **Environment**: Files, dependencies, and related code
- **Specific Questions**: Primary blockers and concerns

#### What You'll Receive

1. **Root Cause Analysis** - Why the issue is occurring
2. **Immediate Fix** - Working solution with explanation
3. **Integration Steps** - How to merge with existing code
4. **Verification Tests** - How to confirm it works
5. **Looking Ahead** - Next steps and patterns to remember

### Phase 4: EVALUATE - Stress Test Before Success

The EVALUATE phase prevents production disasters by systematically assessing your project for critical issues before users find them.

#### Key Elements

- **Implementation Status**: What's working, broken, or missing
- **Critical Issues**: Bugs with reproduction steps
- **Quality Assessment**: Performance, usability, security status
- **Reality Check**: Comparison against original goals
- **Unexpected Discoveries**: What you learned during development

#### What You'll Receive

1. **Issue Triage Report** - Prioritized list of what must be fixed
2. **Targeted Fix Package** - Solutions for critical issues only
3. **Performance Quick Wins** - Easy optimizations with big impact
4. **Security Essentials** - Critical vulnerabilities to address
5. **Launch Confidence Score** - Go/No-Go decision with evidence

### Phase 5: COMMIT - Ship It and Own It

The COMMIT phase transforms your project from "it works on my machine" to "it works for everyone." This final phase ensures professional deployment and sustainable operations.

#### Key Elements

- **Launch Readiness**: Bug fixes, documentation, and testing status
- **Deployment Details**: Platform, access, and configuration
- **Honest Assessment**: Strengths, limitations, and technical debt
- **Goal Achievement**: Comparison against original vision
- **Post-Launch Planning**: Immediate priorities and long-term vision

#### What You'll Receive

1. **Turn-Key Deployment Guide** - Step-by-step deployment instructions
2. **Documentation Package** - README, user guides, and API docs
3. **Production Operations Setup** - Monitoring and maintenance plans
4. **Growth Momentum Plan** - Phased approach for continued development
5. **Success Metrics Dashboard** - How to measure ongoing success

## Implementation with Templates

The ACE Method provides structured templates for each phase, designed to work with modern AI assistants for optimal results. Each template follows a consistent structure:

1. **User Inputs**: Simple fields for project information
2. **AI Instructions**: Advanced prompts for AI assistance
3. **Expected Output**: Clear deliverables for each phase

### Template Structure

Templates are located in the `/Templates` directory:
- `1 Start.md` - Project vision and scope definition
- `2 Analyze.md` - Requirements discovery and architecture
- `3 Create.md` - Iterative development support
- `4 Evaluate.md` - Testing and quality assurance
- `5 Commit.md` - Deployment and operations

### Using the Templates

1. Copy the relevant template for your current phase
2. Fill in the bracketed [  ] sections with your information
3. Paste into your AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
4. Receive structured guidance specific to your project
5. Progress to the next phase when ready

## How It Works

Each phase uses a scientifically-designed template with three sections:

1. **User Inputs** - Simple fields you fill with your project information
2. **AI Instructions** - PhD-level prompts using advanced techniques from Anthropic, OpenAI, and academic research
3. **Expected Output** - Exactly what deliverables you'll receive

**The Magic**: Our AI instructions use techniques like role-based prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, formal methods, and structured output formatting - all invisible to you but dramatically improving results.

## Getting Started

1. **Choose Your Project**: Start with something meaningful but manageable
2. **Begin with START**: Use the template to define your vision clearly
3. **Progress Through Phases**: Let each phase inform the next
4. **Iterate as Needed**: Some phases may require multiple cycles
5. **Complete with COMMIT**: Ensure professional delivery

**Learn by Example**: The `/Examples` directory contains 10 complete project walkthroughs (API Builder, Auth System, Data Dashboard, etc.) showing exactly how to fill out each phase

## Next Steps

1. Navigate to the `/Templates` directory
2. Open `1 Start.md`
3. Fill in your project information
4. Use with your preferred AI assistant
5. Progress through each phase sequentially
