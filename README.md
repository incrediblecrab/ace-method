5. Follow the structured guidance provided

**See Examples**: Check the `/Examples` directory for 10 real-world projects showing how to fill out the templates

## Phases Overview

1. **START** - Transform ideas into clear specifications
2. **ANALYZE** - Uncover hidden requirements and design architecture
3. **CREATE** - Build with continuous problem-solving support
4. **EVALUATE** - Stress test before release
5. **COMMIT** - Deploy and establish operations

## What You Get

**Phase 1: START** - Reality check, architecture recommendations, personalized learning path
**Phase 2: ANALYZE** - Hidden requirements, system design, risk mitigation plan
**Phase 3: CREATE** - Root cause analysis, working solutions, next steps
**Phase 4: EVALUATE** - Issue prioritization, critical fixes, launch readiness
**Phase 5: COMMIT** - Deployment guide, documentation, monitoring setup

## Requirements

- Any AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- Your project idea
- 5-10 minutes per phase

## Usage

Each template contains:
- **Section 1**: User inputs (your project information)
- **Section 2**: AI instructions (generates comprehensive analysis)
- **Section 3**: Expected output (what you'll receive)
