# Cache Layer - ACE Method Example

## Phase 1: START - Define Your Project

### SECTION 1: USER INPUTS - REPLACE CONTENT WITHIN [...] WITH YOUR INFORMATION

#### Project Identity
**What I'm Building:**
[A distributed caching layer built on Redis that provides intelligent caching with TTL management, cache invalidation strategies, warm-up capabilities, and multi-level caching with automatic fallback]

**The 5-Minute Pitch:**
[CacheFlow is a smart distributed caching system that dramatically improves application performance. It features intelligent TTL management, tag-based invalidation, automatic cache warming, real-time hit/miss analytics, and seamless integration with existing applications. Built on Redis with a powerful abstraction layer, it supports multiple caching strategies, handles cache stampedes gracefully, and provides detailed insights into cache performance while reducing database load by up to 95%.]

#### The Reality Check

**Who Will Use This:**
[High-traffic web applications, E-commerce platforms with catalog data, API services needing response caching, Real-time applications requiring low latency, Microservices architectures]

**The Problem It Solves:**
[Eliminates database bottlenecks, Reduces API response times, Prevents cache stampedes, Simplifies cache invalidation, Provides cache performance visibility]

**Why They'll Choose This:**
[Sub-millisecond response times, 99.9% cache availability, Tag-based invalidation, Automatic stampede protection, Zero-config integration]

#### Constraints & Resources

**Technical Constraints:**
[Must handle 1M requests/second, Support 100GB+ cache size, Maintain <1ms latency, Work with Redis Cluster, Support multiple data types]

**Time Investment:**
[3 weeks for core caching layer, 2 weeks for invalidation system, 1 week for monitoring, 1 week for client libraries, 1 week for documentation]

**Financial Reality:**
[Redis cluster: $500/month for adequate memory, Monitoring infrastructure: $100/month, Load balancers: $50/month, Backup storage: $30/month, Total: ~$680/month]

#### Scope Definition

**Core Features (MVP):**

## Phase 2: ANALYZE - Deep Requirements Discovery

### SECTION 1: USER INPUTS - REPLACE CONTENT WITHIN [...] WITH YOUR INFORMATION

#### Problem Deep Dive

**The Core Challenge:**
[Building a caching layer that intelligently manages memory usage, prevents cache stampedes during invalidation, maintains consistency across distributed nodes, provides flexible invalidation strategies, and delivers insights into cache effectiveness while maintaining sub-millisecond latency]

**Current Pain Points:**
[Cache stampedes crash databases, Stale data serves to users, No visibility into cache performance, Complex invalidation logic, Memory usage unpredictable]

**Success Metrics:**
[99%+ cache hit ratio for hot data, <1ms average response time, Zero cache-related outages, 90% reduction in database load, 100% data consistency]

#### User Journey Mapping

**Primary User Flow:**
[App requests data → Cache layer checks Redis → Cache hit returns immediately → Cache miss fetches from source → Data cached with smart TTL → Invalidation triggered on updates → Analytics track performance]

**Critical Touchpoints:**
[Integration simplicity, Cache hit performance, Miss handling efficiency, Invalidation accuracy, Monitoring clarity, Memory management]

**Failure Points:**
[Connection pool exhaustion, Cache stampede on popular keys, Invalidation cascades, Memory overflow, Network partitions, Stale data served]

## Phase 3: CREATE - Implementation Problem Solving

### SECTION 1: USER INPUTS - REPLACE CONTENT WITHIN [...] WITH YOUR INFORMATION

#### Current Context

**What I'm Building:**
[Implementing the cache stampede protection system that prevents thousands of simultaneous requests from overwhelming the database when a popular cache key expires]

**Where I'm Stuck:**
[The distributed lock mechanism for stampede protection is causing deadlocks. Also having issues with the "smart refresh" approach where we refresh cache before expiry. The tag-based invalidation is causing memory bloat with too many reverse indexes.]

**What I've Tried:**
[Implemented distributed locks with Redis, tried probabilistic early expiration, used Lua scripts for atomic operations, attempted tag storage optimization, explored promise-based deduplication]

#### Code State

**Relevant Code:**
```typescript
// Current problematic stampede protection
class CacheClient {
  private redis: Redis.Cluster;
  private locks: Map<string, Promise<any>> = new Map();
  
  async get(key: string, fetcher: () => Promise<any>): Promise<any> {
    const cached = await this.redis.get(key);
    if (cached) {
      return JSON.parse(cached);
    }
    
    // This causes deadlocks with distributed systems
    const lockKey = `lock:${key}`;
    const lockId = uuidv4();
    
    try {
      // SET NX doesn't work well in cluster mode
      const acquired = await this.redis.set(lockKey, lockId, 'NX', 'EX', 30);
      
      if (!acquired) {
        // Spin waiting - causes high CPU
        while (true) {
          await sleep(10);
          const cached = await this.redis.get(key);
          if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached);
          
          const lockExists = await this.redis.exists(lockKey);
          if (!lockExists) break;
        }
      }
      
      const data = await fetcher();
      await this.set(key, data);
      return data;
      
    } finally {
      // Race condition: lock might be expired
      const currentLock = await this.redis.get(lockKey);
      if (currentLock === lockId) {
        await this.redis.del(lockKey);
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Smart refresh not working properly
  async set(key: string, value: any, ttl: number = 3600): Promise<void> {
    const serialized = JSON.stringify(value);
    
    // This doesn't account for fetch time
    const smartTTL = ttl * 0.8; // Refresh at 80% of TTL
    
    await this.redis.setex(key, ttl, serialized);
    
    // This creates too many timers
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.refreshKey(key);
    }, smartTTL * 1000);
  }
}

// Tag-based invalidation with memory issues
class TagManager {
  private tagPrefix = 'tag:';
  private keyPrefix = 'keys:';
  
  async addTags(key: string, tags: string[]): Promise<void> {
    const pipeline = this.redis.pipeline();
    
    // This creates too many keys
    for (const tag of tags) {
      pipeline.sadd(`${this.tagPrefix}${tag}`, key);
    }
    
    // Reverse index also bloats memory
    pipeline.sadd(`${this.keyPrefix}${key}`, ...tags);
    
    await pipeline.exec();
  }
  
  async invalidateTag(tag: string): Promise<void> {
    const keys = await this.redis.smembers(`${this.tagPrefix}${tag}`);
    
    if (keys.length > 0) {
      // This can be very slow with many keys
      const pipeline = this.redis.pipeline();
      
      for (const key of keys) {
        pipeline.del(key);
        // Cleanup reverse index
        const keyTags = await this.redis.smembers(`${this.keyPrefix}${key}`);
        for (const t of keyTags) {
          pipeline.srem(`${this.tagPrefix}${t}`, key);
        }
        pipeline.del(`${this.keyPrefix}${key}`);
      }
      
      await pipeline.exec();
    }
  }
}

// Memory management issues
class MemoryManager {
  async evictLRU(needed: number): Promise<void> {
    // This is too slow for real-time eviction
    const keys = await this.redis.keys('*');
    const keyTTLs: Array<{key: string, ttl: number}> = [];
    
    for (const key of keys) {
      const ttl = await this.redis.ttl(key);
      keyTTLs.push({ key, ttl });
    }
    
    // Sort by TTL (not true LRU)
    keyTTLs.sort((a, b) => a.ttl - b.ttl);
    
    let freed = 0;
    for (const { key } of keyTTLs) {
      if (freed >= needed) break;
      
      const size = await this.getKeySize(key);
      await this.redis.del(key);
      freed += size;
    }
  }
}
```
