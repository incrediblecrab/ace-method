## Phase 2: ANALYZE - Deep Requirements Discovery

### SECTION 1: USER INPUTS - REPLACE CONTENT WITHIN [...] WITH YOUR INFORMATION

#### Problem Deep Dive

**The Core Challenge:**
[Building a robust MCP server that safely executes arbitrary tools requested by AI models while maintaining security boundaries, handling async operations efficiently, providing clear error messages, and ensuring reliable communication even under high load]

**Current Pain Points:**

## Phase 3: CREATE - Implementation Problem Solving

### SECTION 1: USER INPUTS - REPLACE CONTENT WITHIN [...] WITH YOUR INFORMATION

#### Current Context

**What I'm Building:**
[Implementing the tool execution sandbox that safely runs custom tools while preventing resource exhaustion, handling timeouts gracefully, and maintaining isolation between different tool executions]

**Where I'm Stuck:**
[The Docker-based sandbox is adding too much latency to tool execution. Also having issues with resource limits causing legitimate tools to fail. The tool state isolation isn't working properly - tools can see each other's temporary files.]

**What I've Tried:**
[Implemented Docker containers per execution, tried process isolation with Node.js, used VM2 for JavaScript sandboxing, attempted Worker Threads for isolation, explored WebAssembly for sandboxing]

#### Code State

**Relevant Code:**
```typescript
// Current problematic sandbox implementation
class ToolSandbox {
  private dockerClient: Docker;
  private activeContainers: Map<string, Docker.Container> = new Map();

  async executeTool(tool: Tool, params: any): Promise<any> {
    // Docker container creation is too slow
    const container = await this.dockerClient.createContainer({
      Image: 'mcp-sandbox:latest',
      Cmd: ['node', 'execute.js'],
      HostConfig: {
        Memory: 512 * 1024 * 1024, // 512MB
        CpuQuota: 50000, // 50% CPU
        AutoRemove: true
      },
      Env: [
        `TOOL_NAME=${tool.name}`,
        `PARAMS=${JSON.stringify(params)}`
      ]
    });

    const startTime = Date.now();
    await container.start();

    // This timeout handling doesn't clean up properly
    const timeout = setTimeout(async () => {
      try {
        await container.kill();
      } catch (e) {
        console.error('Failed to kill container:', e);
      }
    }, tool.timeout || 30000);

    try {
      // Streaming logs is inefficient
      const stream = await container.logs({
        stdout: true,
        stderr: true,
        follow: true
      });

      const output = await this.streamToString(stream);
      clearTimeout(timeout);

      // No proper error detection
      return JSON.parse(output);
    } catch (error) {
      clearTimeout(timeout);
      throw new ToolExecutionError(`Tool execution failed: ${error.message}`);
    } finally {
      // Cleanup race condition
      this.activeContainers.delete(container.id);
    }
  }

  // Tool isolation not working
  async loadTool(toolPath: string): Promise<Tool> {
    // This shares the same require cache
    const toolModule = require(toolPath);
    
    // No validation of tool interface
    return {
      name: toolModule.name,
      description: toolModule.description,
      parameters: toolModule.parameters,
      execute: toolModule.execute
    };
  }
}

// MCP protocol handler with issues
class MCPServer {
  private ws: WebSocket.Server;
  private sandbox: ToolSandbox;
  private activeSessions: Map<string, Session> = new Map();

  async handleRequest(request: JsonRpcRequest): Promise<JsonRpcResponse> {
    try {
      switch (request.method) {
        case 'tools/list':
          return this.handleToolsList();
        
        case 'tools/call':
          // No request validation
          return await this.handleToolCall(request.params);
        
        default:
          throw new Error(`Unknown method: ${request.method}`);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      // Error responses don't follow spec
      return {
        jsonrpc: '2.0',
        id: request.id,
        error: {
          code: -32603,
          message: error.message
        }
      };
    }
  }

  async handleToolCall(params: any): Promise<any> {
    const { name, arguments: args } = params;
    
    // No permission checking
    const tool = this.registry.getTool(name);
    if (!tool) {
      throw new Error(`Tool not found: ${name}`);
    }

    // Missing parameter validation
    const result = await this.sandbox.executeTool(tool, args);
    
    // No result transformation
    return {
      jsonrpc: '2.0',
      result
    };
  }
}

// Tool registry with concurrency issues
class ToolRegistry {
  private tools: Map<string, Tool> = new Map();
  private loadingTools: Set<string> = new Set();

  async registerTool(toolPath: string): Promise<void> {
    // Race condition with concurrent registrations
    if (this.loadingTools.has(toolPath)) {
      return;
    }

    this.loadingTools.add(toolPath);
    
    try {
      const tool = await this.loadTool(toolPath);
      
      // No version checking
      this.tools.set(tool.name, tool);
    } finally {
      this.loadingTools.delete(toolPath);
    }
  }
}
```
