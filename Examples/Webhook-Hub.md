## Phase 2: ANALYZE - Deep Requirements Discovery

### SECTION 1: USER INPUTS - REPLACE CONTENT WITHIN [...] WITH YOUR INFORMATION

#### Problem Deep Dive

**The Core Challenge:**
[Building a system that can reliably receive webhooks at scale, queue them without loss, handle various failure scenarios, retry intelligently without overwhelming destinations, and provide visibility into the entire webhook lifecycle while maintaining sub-second processing times]

**Current Pain Points:**
[Webhooks lost during deployments, No visibility into delivery failures, Manual retry process is error-prone, Different signature validation per provider, No way to replay failed webhooks, Debugging webhook issues is difficult]

**Success Metrics:**
[99.99% webhook delivery rate, Process 10k webhooks/second, Median processing time < 50ms, Support 1000 concurrent destinations, 30-day retention with instant search]

#### User Journey Mapping

**Primary User Flow:**
[External service sends webhook → System receives and validates → Webhook queued in Redis → Worker processes webhook → Delivery attempted to destination → Success logged or retry scheduled → User monitors via dashboard]

**Critical Touchpoints:**
[Webhook receipt confirmation, Signature validation speed, Queue reliability, Delivery attempt timing, Retry strategy effectiveness, Monitoring dashboard clarity]

**Failure Points:**
[Invalid signatures block legitimate webhooks, Queue overflow during traffic spikes, Destination timeouts cause backlogs, Retry storms overwhelm destinations, Lost webhooks during Redis failover]

## Phase 3: CREATE - Implementation Problem Solving

### SECTION 1: USER INPUTS - REPLACE CONTENT WITHIN [...] WITH YOUR INFORMATION

#### Current Context

**What I'm Building:**
[Implementing the intelligent retry mechanism that handles failed webhook deliveries with exponential backoff, jitter to prevent thundering herds, and circuit breakers to protect struggling destinations]

**Where I'm Stuck:**
[The retry logic is creating "retry storms" that overwhelm destination servers. Also having issues with the circuit breaker triggering too aggressively and blocking legitimate retries. The exponential backoff calculation isn't accounting for destination-specific requirements.]

**What I've Tried:**
[Implemented basic exponential backoff, added random jitter to spread retries, tried circuit breaker pattern, used destination health checks, attempted adaptive retry intervals]

#### Code State

**Relevant Code:**
```javascript
// Current problematic retry implementation
class RetryManager {
  constructor() {
    this.retryQueues = new Map();
    this.circuitBreakers = new Map();
  }

  async scheduleRetry(webhook, destination, attemptNumber) {
    // This creates retry storms
    const delay = Math.pow(2, attemptNumber) * 1000; // Simple exponential
    
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.attemptDelivery(webhook, destination, attemptNumber + 1);
    }, delay);
  }

  // Circuit breaker too aggressive
  async attemptDelivery(webhook, destination, attemptNumber) {
    const circuitBreaker = this.getCircuitBreaker(destination);
    
    if (circuitBreaker.isOpen()) {
      // This blocks all webhooks to destination
      await this.scheduleRetry(webhook, destination, attemptNumber);
      return;
    }

    try {
      const response = await this.deliver(webhook, destination);
      
      if (response.status >= 500) {
        circuitBreaker.recordFailure();
        throw new Error(`Server error: ${response.status}`);
      }
      
      circuitBreaker.recordSuccess();
      await this.markDelivered(webhook);
      
    } catch (error) {
      circuitBreaker.recordFailure();
      
      if (attemptNumber < this.maxRetries) {
        await this.scheduleRetry(webhook, destination, attemptNumber);
      } else {
        await this.markFailed(webhook);
      }
    }
  }

  // No jitter or spreading of retries
  getCircuitBreaker(destination) {
    if (!this.circuitBreakers.has(destination)) {
      this.circuitBreakers.set(destination, new CircuitBreaker({
        threshold: 5, // Opens after 5 failures
        timeout: 60000 // 1 minute timeout
      }));
    }
    return this.circuitBreakers.get(destination);
  }
}

// Webhook processor with queue issues
class WebhookProcessor {
  constructor() {
    this.redis = new Redis();
    this.processing = new Set();
  }

  async processWebhooks() {
    while (true) {
      try {
        // This can cause duplicate processing
        const webhook = await this.redis.lpop('webhook:queue');
        if (!webhook) {
          await this.sleep(100);
          continue;
        }

        const data = JSON.parse(webhook);
        
        // No deduplication
        if (this.processing.has(data.id)) {
          continue;
        }

        this.processing.add(data.id);
        
        // No proper error handling
        await this.deliverWebhook(data);
        
        this.processing.delete(data.id);
        
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Processing error:', error);
        // Webhook is lost here
      }
    }
  }

  // Delivery without proper timeout
  async deliverWebhook(webhook) {
    const { destination, payload, headers } = webhook;
    
    // No timeout control
    const response = await fetch(destination, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        ...headers,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(payload)
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Delivery failed: ${response.status}`);
    }

    // No delivery confirmation stored
    return response;
  }
}

// Queue monitoring with performance issues
class QueueMonitor {
  async getQueueStats() {
    const stats = {
      pending: await this.redis.llen('webhook:queue'),
      processing: await this.redis.scard('webhook:processing'),
      failed: await this.redis.llen('webhook:failed'),
      delivered: await this.redis.get('webhook:delivered:count')
    };

    // This query is too slow
    const recentWebhooks = await this.redis.lrange('webhook:recent', 0, 100);
    stats.recent = recentWebhooks.map(w => JSON.parse(w));

    return stats;
  }
}
```
